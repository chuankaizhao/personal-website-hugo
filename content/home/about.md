# Biography

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in [Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering](http://chbe.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), advised by Professor [Diwakar Shukla](http://www.shuklagroup.org/). Also, I am enrolled in the Graduate Concentration program in [Computational Science and Engineering](http://cse.illinois.edu/) at Illinois. 

My research is mainly focused on combining principles and theory of machine learning to applications of molecular simulations in understanding complex biological and chemical processes. I develop and integrate state-of-the-art computational and statistical methods to understand biomolecule and polymer dynamics related to fields in protein-ligand binding, protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions, as well as polymer self-assembly.

Before I joined Illinois in 2015, I pursued my bachelor degree in [Materials Science and Engineering](http://en.smse.sjtu.edu.cn/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I worked with Professor [Lingti Kong](http://nes.sjtu.edu.cn/english/home.htm) on investigating metastable materials properties using computational methods, including molecular dynamics and density functional theory.
