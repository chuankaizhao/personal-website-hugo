Recent advances in biotechnology and molecular biology have opened new and efficient routes for the direct modification of large intact genomes. Programmable nucleases such as the CRISPR/Cas9 system and transcription activator-like ector nucleases (TALENs) provide a powerful set of molecular tools for genome engineering. Despite a growing interest in gene editing, several open questions remain regarding the molecular machinery in these systems, including the fundamental search and binding behavior as well as the role of non-target binding and specificity. 

In collaboration with Professors [Charles M. Schroeder](http://schroeder.scs.illinois.edu/) and [Huimin Zhao](http://faculty.scs.illinois.edu/~zhaogrp/) Groups at Illinois, this project aims to combine experimental and computational approaches to elucidate the molecular mechanism of TALE protein specificity and its target binding to DNA. We utilize molecular simulation and statistical modeling to obtain insights into the structural and energetic basis of TALE-DNA binding.
