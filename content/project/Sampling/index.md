Molecular simulations can be utilized to predict protein structure ensembles and dynamics, though sufficient sampling of molecular ensembles and identification of key biologically relevant conformations remains challenging. To partially address thess challenges, we utilize distributed computing techniques and advanced Markov state models for obtaining mechanistic insights into bimolecular dynamics. We aim to further develop these sampling methods for molecular simulations to improve time efficiency and prediction accuracy.  

Low-resolution experimental techniques provide valuable structural information on biomolecule at near-native conditions, which are often combined with molecular simulations to determine and refine protein structural ensembles. This project aims to integrate experimental data on protein ensemble and dynamics with Markov state model-based adaptive sampling strategy to enhance time efficiency of unbiased MD simulations and identify functionally relevant conformations of proteins and complexes. 

Also, we aim to develop and integrate deep learning frameworks to identify optimal reaction coordiantes for sampling biomolecular dynamics and modeling simulation data. We plan to implement these methods in the [NAMD software](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/), a scalable molecular dynamics package developed at Illinois campus.
