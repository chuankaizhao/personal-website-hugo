In recent years, solution processable semiconducting polymers have been under intense investigations due to their diverse applications from printed electronics to biomedical devices. However, controlling the macromolecular assembly across length scales during solution coating remains a key challenge, largely due to the disparity in timescales of polymer assembly and high-throughput printing/coating.

In collaboration with Professor [Ying Diao](http://diao.scs.illinois.edu/Diao_Lab/Home.html) Group at Illinois, we propose the concept of dynamic templating to expedite polymer nucleation and the ensuing assembly process. We have employed ionic liquids as the dynamic template in meniscus-guided coating experiments, which results in highly aligned, highly crystalline donor-acceptor polymer thin films over large area and promoted charge transport. Our molecular dynamics simulations help to unravel the key molecular mechanism underlying the dynamic-template-directed polymer assembly process. Following our previous work, we are actively developing new dynamic templates for polymer assembly processes.
