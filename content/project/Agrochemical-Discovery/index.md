The discoveries of plant hormone agonists and antagonists open up plethora of possibilities to chemically modulate plant growth, development and stress responses. Phenotype-based screens of compound libraries, including a high-throughput scale, has become an indispensable tool to identify compounds that can activate certain hormone signaling pathways. However, the screening of large compound libraries is generally time-consuming, expensive and inefficient. 

Computational chemistry and machine learning frameworks have become indispensable components in modern drug design processes, including hit discovery, hit-to-lead filtering, and lead optimization. This project aims to extend these computational frameworks for agrochemical discovery. The goal is to facilitate chemical design for selectively targeting plant hormone receptors.
