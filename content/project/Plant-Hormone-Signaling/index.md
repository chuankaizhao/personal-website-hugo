Plant hormones, the small molecules produced in plants, regulate all aspects of plant activities such as growth, development and stress responses. In recent years, substantial structural and biochemical studies have achieved significant advances in understanding the molecular mechanism of plant hormone perceptions by their receptors and subsequent activation of signaling cascades. However, dynamic and energetic aspects of plant hormone perception and subsequent receptor conformational change processes remain elusive.

Here, we utilize large-scale molecular dynamics simulations and statistical modeling approaches to uncover structural, dynamic, energetic basis of receptor-hormone recognitions, their down-regulations by post-translational modifications, and protein-protein interactions involved in signaling networks. We aim to utilize these computational tools to obtain deep understandings of the activation processes of plant hormone receptors, which will faciliate future chemical design and protein engineering efforts in regulating plant activities.
