abstract    = "In plants, abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway regulates water stress resistance and is a key target for agrochemical control of drought resistance. Recent structural and biochemical studies significantly promote understandings of ABA signaling network, however provide limited information about the dynamics of ABA binding to receptors. Molecular insights into ABA recognition by plants can create new opportunities for development of drought resistant agrochemicals. Here we report the binding pathways of ABA and two ABA agonists, pyrabactin and quinabactin, to monomeric PYL receptors using extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Markov state models (MSMs). Our results compare the structure transitions of receptors that occur in response to ligands via characterizing the intermediate states along binding pathways. Our findings shed light on major barriers to binding and role of water in binding. Our results show tyrosine nitration of PYL5 receptor blocks ABA binding pathways and prohibits receptor activation. Overall, this work demonstrates the power of MD simulation and MSM in elucidating the detailed mechanisms of receptor activation."
