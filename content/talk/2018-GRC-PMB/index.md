abstract    = "Globally worsening drought conditions pose an increased threat to agriculture productivity. In plants, the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway regulates resistance to water-deficit stress and serves as a key target for agrochemical control of drought tolerance. Recent structural and biochemical studies shed light on ABA signaling network, however provide limited information about the dynamics of ABA perception and subsequent activation of the ABA receptors. Moreover, the ABA receptors are subjected to various types of post-translational modification that can inhibit ABA signaling and further prevent drought stress responses by plants, while the molecular mechanisms have also been elusive. Here, we utilize large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (~300 Î¼s aggregate) to capture the atomic details of ABA binding to the PYL5, the PYL10 receptors and the post-translationally modified PYL5 receptor through tyrosine nitration, and the subsequent conformational changes of the receptors. We also report the binding free energy landscapes, allowing for a thorough investigation of the thermodynamics and kinetics of ABA bindings. Our results suggest that ABA binding is necessary but not sufficient condition for receptor activation. The major free energy barrier to ABA binding appears to be associated with the substantial dewetting of both ABA and the receptor as ABA binds to the receptor. Our results demonstrate that the nitrated PYL5 receptor blocks ABA binding pathway due to the altered binding pocket structure. Overall, our work establishes a powerful paradigm for understanding drought resistance signaling at molecular level, and will facilitate informed genetic manipulation of ABA receptors and improved design of new ABA mimicking agonists for more effective drought control."
