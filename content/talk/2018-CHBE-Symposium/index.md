abstract    = "Plant hormones are essential small molecules produced in plants that mediate growth, development and stress responses. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a hormone that helps plants survive drought conditions by mediating guard cell closure. Since the identification of PYR/PYL/RCAR ABA receptors, the mechanism underlying ABA signaling has been intensively investigated. However, the structural, dynamic and energetic aspects of ABA-mediated activation of the receptors and their down-regulation by various types of post-translational modifications remain elusive. Using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations (400 μs aggregate) and Markov state models, we establish complete ABA recognition pathways by three sub-type receptors and a modified receptor through tyrosine nitration. Energetic landscapes reveal that ABA binding is necessary but insufficient for full receptor activation, and ABA must surmount a large free energy barrier to bind the receptors. The major binding barrier appears to be associated with substantial dewetting of both ABA (up to 30 water molecules per ABA) and receptor (up to 10 water molecules per receptor) during ABA binding. We also quantify the localized water hydration structure and thermodynamics in the receptor binding sites in order to understand the role of displacing water upon binding on ABA perception. Finally, our results suggest that tyrosine nitration of PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors significantly alters the binding pocket structure, thereby preventing ABA binding and subsequent activation of stress responses. Overall, these computational studies provide new mechanistic insights into plant hormone signaling, and further provide potential avenues for design of ABA agonists for effective drought control."
