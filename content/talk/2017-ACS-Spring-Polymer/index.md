abstract    = "Controlled morphology evolution via directed assembly has played a central role in the manufacturing of modern electronics and energetic materials. In recent years, solution processable semiconducting polymers have demonstrated potential uses in a diverse range of applications from organic electronics to medical devices, thanks to rapid materials innovation and six orders of magnitude improvement in charge carrier mobilities over the last thirty years. It is well-demonstrated that the charge transport properties of semiconducting polymers depend strongly on morphological parameters such as π–π stacking distance, degree of crystallinity and in-plane alignment of polymer backbones. However, controlling the molecular assembly of semiconducting polymers during solution coating methods compatible with high-throughput, large-area solution coating methods remains a key challenge. As a result, printed polymer thin films frequently exhibit non-ideal morphologies limiting their device performance and commercial viability. Crystallization of a molecular solid from solution often initiates at solid–liquid interfaces. Thus, rational design of templates has traditionally been an important approach for manufacturing a wide range of materials from inorganic electronics to pharmaceuticals. Inspired by biological processes, we designed a composite template to control the multiscale assembly of semiconducting polymers via surface-induced crystallization during meniscus-guided coating. Template surface chemistry can be manipulated to interact cooperatively with the assembling polymers and to optimize polymer-template interactions leading to a level of morphology control otherwise not possible using common substrates. Molecular dynamic simulations verified our design notion and the critical role of template surface structure in expediting the crystallization process. Morphological characterizations demonstrated that this method, along with uniaxial coating, induced long-range in-plane alignment and produced highly crystalline microstructures of conjugated polymers over large area (>1cm2). Tunable degree of alignment in template-directed thin films provides an opportunity for investigating alignment-charge transport relationship. Our methodology has broad implications, given the importance of surface-induced crystallization across many disciplines."
