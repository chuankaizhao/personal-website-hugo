abstract    = "Abscisic acid (ABA) plays a central role in regulating response to low water conditions in plants by binding to the PYR/PYL/RCAR family of receptor proteins. Worsening drought-like conditions across the globe have prompted design of ABA agonists as a means of agrochemical control of plant drought resistance. Two recently discovered ABA analogues, pyrabactin and quinabactin, have been shown to selectively target the monomeric receptor PYL5. Though these agonists have been studied extensively in vivo and in vitro, none have effectively utilized modern methods of computational biochemistry to uncover and compare the specific structural transitions that occur in response to these two ABA agonists. Here we report the conformational binding pathways of pyrabactin and quinabactin to PYL5 and characterize key intermediate states using equilibrium all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and Markov State Models (MSMs). Our findings show that pyrabactin and quinabactin have highly similar binding mechanisms and intermediate states. These intermediate states have high potential to serve as targets for rational design of ABA agonists. Overall, our results demonstrate the power of MSMs and molecular dynamics to provide detailed mechanistic insights into receptor activation."
